Why learn HTML?
Every webpage you look at is written in a language called HTML. 
You can think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. 
In this course, we'll use HTML to add paragraphs, headings, images and links to a webpage.

In the editor to the right, 
there's a tab called test.html. 
This is the file we'll type our HTML into. 
See the code with the <>s? 
That's HTML! Like any language, 
it has its own special syntax (rules for communicating).

When we press Save & Submit Code, 
the results tab will act like an Internet browser 
(e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer). 
A browser's job is to transform the code in test.html into a recognizable webpage!
It knows how to lay out the page by following the HTML syntax.

Instructions
To the right, we have a test.html file.
Change the text on line 2 
(the bit between <strong> and </strong>) 
to anything you like!
Hit Save & Submit Code, and you'll see how the test.html file would look in a browser. 
Did you see that? The <strong></strong> tags made our text bold!

Hint
If you're not sure what to change the text on line 2 to, 
why not change Feel free to change this text. to I'm about to learn HTML?

Don't change or remove the <strong> bit or the </strong> bit! 
We'll explain what those do soon.
